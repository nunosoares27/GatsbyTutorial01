    "description": "The Coolermaster Hyper 212 Evo RR-212E-20PK-R2 82.9 CFM sleeve bearing cpu fan is one of the best processor fans ever made for Intel & AMD chips - especially with people interested in overclocking. This is a 5-star review type fan from Cooler Master. With the CM 212 Evo you get the most popular cooling product ever released and for good reason - this really is a beast of cooling performance. With a 120mm PWM fan optimized to provide the best cpu cooling experience and heat controlling potential for all the latest processors out there, this fan is guaranteed to reduce your temps over a stock fan even at idle. The fan is mounted onto a highly conductive aluminum heatsink measuring 116 x 51 x 159 mm. Featuring four patented CDC heat pipes that are tightly packed into a flat array on the base. This acts as a virtual vapor chamber that dissipates an enormous amount of heat. The aluminum fin construction has been optimized to give the perfect performance stability between high and low speed fan operations. This cooler will blow any stock cooler out of the park and at this price point it's an unbeatable value.",
